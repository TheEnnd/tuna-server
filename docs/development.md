# Developer docs

This a work in progress.

## Setup

This project is configured to work in Vagrant. After cloning the project

    # start vagrant
    cd /vagrant
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

    # start local mongo
    cd /vagrant/build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d 

    cd /vagrant/src
    yarn --no-bin-links 
    npm rebuild node-sass --no-bin-links
    jspm install -y

You should always use yarn to install node modules, installing with npm fails.

### Run

The easiest way to to run the project is

    cd /src
    node index

To start the dev environment with debugging enabled, sass watching, server restarting etc, run

    cd /src
    npm run dev

Force app to wait for debugger with

    npm run dev -- --brk
    npm run dev -- --break

View at http://localhost:48004

Visual Studio Code debug config is committed with project source, so if you start with the above you can debug immediately.

### Mongo 

Part of the dev tools includes a Mongo-express admin interface already running at http://localhost:49002
If you want to connect with your own mongo client, the dev Mongo database is exposed via http://localhost:49001

### Debug Chrome

- on the host system, get the debug url with http://127.0.0.1:9222/json
- Post url in chrome, add break points and you're off

## Build

### Frontend only 

    cd /src
    ./build-frontend.sh

This is useful for testing Jspm & Sass bundling etc.

### Local docker build

To build a docker container image of your local code

    cd /build
    sh ./build.sh

To test your container build locally

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up -d

Open in browser from host machine

    http://localhost:58002
